# 5e Party and Character Generator
Create a party of characters and foils to oppose them for 5e!

This generator, unlike other character generators, focuses on creating a party of characters over focusing on any individual character. After a company of characters is generated, the program will prompt the user to decide whether to generate a foil party. A foil party is a group of Game Master controlled character-like NPCs where each foil is intended to be the antithesis to one of the player characters. A foil’s class is dependent on the player character’s class the foil specifically opposes. Because these NPCs are not meant to be controlled by players, the foil’s stats are based on their class rather than rolled dice.

Since both player and non-player characters are abstracted and not fully fleshed out, no class abilities are printed out for the PCs and equipment choices are based on class, the 5e Party Generator is a tool made for the Game Master rather than the players. The text file generated for each party has all the basic information needed to use the characters in combat, something suited for GMs more than players.
